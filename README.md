# text-calculator
A simple calculator which uses inputs of the command line
works by input of first number, second number and the operate code (add, sub, mul, div, square, cube)
gives output
if you use the directinput version it is basic and more suited for an automatic input and gives no intimation if the required input but follows the same order as the other version
